      Rob is opening his gift gallery next month. Some of his friends would help him decorate the gallery for opening day and set up items on the shelves by using the estimated values of the items and money and rounding off the numbers where necessary. Would you like to help him as well?

      Finally, the opening day of the gallery arrived. Rob and his friends enjoyed their time, were also grateful for the little math they learned during their preparation days and were more enthusiastic about the new things they would learn while running their gift gallery.
